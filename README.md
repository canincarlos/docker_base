# Django, NextJS/React, Postgres, Nginx All-in-One

This is a work in progress, though the Django does install SciPy; still waiting to test the Pillow install.

### The Project

The idea is to have one basic app ecosystem that is able to be deployed quickly and easily; using known and robust specifications.

NextJS/React is being used, as it is quickly becoming an industry standard that I am behooved to learn.

## Updates

- [ ] Access http calls via db/server/client, etc
- [ ] Utilize a wait-for method to build client
- [ ] Persist database
